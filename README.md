**Welcome, This is an introduction to Lab 2 where i will use a geo-tagged tweet collection and create a visualization, a map, on QGIS.**

First, i created a Twitter KPI and filtered the parameters to collecet specific geotagged tweets. I wanted to focus my topic on the ongoing genocide and war in Tigray, a northern region of Ethiopia. This is a very important topic in general and especially to me personally. 

For this awareness to be spread, Ethiopians and non ethiopians have been using hashtags like: 

> - #Tigraygenocide
> - #WaronTigray
> - #StopwaronTigray


But the most common was "#stopwaronTigray" which is what i used to be able to get the most amount of geo-tagged tweet collection, i allowed the time limit to run until 300 to get more information for that amount of time. 

After i got my csv file of the tweet collecction, i went to create a visualization on QGIS to show specifically where those tweets came from. I focused my lication search on the Unites States and that is what my map is going to have. 

The picture above is the final map that i created, the orange dots shows that people have tweeted about Tigray's ongoing war and genocide usisng the hashtag #stopwaronTigray. 
There is more dots in Washington State, California, Washington DC, and Texas. This is because those states have big Ethiopian communities compared to other states. Majority of Ethiopians from back home end up in one of these states. It would make sense that those states have more tweets in those areas.
