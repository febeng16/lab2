**Welcome, This is an introduction to Lab 2 where i will use a geo-tagged tweet collection and create a visualization, a map, on QGIS.**

First, i created a Twitter KPI and filtered the parameters to collecet specific geotagged tweets. I wanted to focus my topic on the ongoing genocide and war in Tigray, a northern region of Ethiopia. This is a very important topic in general and especially to me personally. 

For this awareness to be spread, Ethiopians and non ethiopians have been using hashtags like: 
'''
#Tigraygenocide
#waronTigray
#StopwaronTigray
'''

But the most common was "#stopwaronTigray" which is what i used to be able to get the most amount of geo-tagged tweet collection, i allowed the time limit to run until 300 to get more information for that amount of time.
